This project uses data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning models to predict whether a borrower's loan will default based on trends of borrower's financial outcomes. In the case of a defaulted loan, the model also predicts how much money the bank will lose.

A1 - EDA and Data Visualization of Initial Varaibles for Insurance Risk, including OHE and Data Imputation

A2 - Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict loan default probability and loan loss amount

A3 - Linear and Logistic Regression Models for Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Forward Selection Models to predict loan default probability and loan loss amount

A4 - TensorFlow NNs to predict loan default probability and loan loss amount
